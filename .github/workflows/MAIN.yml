How to automatically close your issues once you merge a PR

How to get more suggestions from GitHub Copilot
Lots of people have been talking about and sharing their GitHub Profile READMEs. It was a project we launched last year and developers are loving it. As this feature became more popular, more developers were building templates, plugins, and apps for you to use on your profile.

This post from Supritha caught my attention. I like the way they talk about various pieces of code to have on your GitHub Profile README.

How to have an awesome GitHub profile ?

#github #markdown #opensource #git
One of the comments from Guillaume Falourd pointed to a really cool project from Platane.

Generates a snake game from a github user contributions graph

github contribution grid snake animation
Pull a github user's contribution graph Make it a snake Game, generate a snake path where the cells get eaten in an orderly fashion.

Generate a gif or svg image.

Available as github action. It can automatically generate a new image each day. Which makes for great github profile readme

Usage
github action

- uses: Platane/snk@v3
  with
    # github user name to read the contribution graph from (**required**)
    # using action context var `github.repository_owner` or specified user
    github_user_name: ${{ github.repository_owner }}

    # list of files to generate.
    # one file per line. Each output can be customized with options as query string.
    #
    #  supported options:
    #  - palette:     A preset of color, one of [github, github-dark, github-light]
    #  - color_snake: Color of the snake
    #  - color_dots:  Coma separated list of dots color.

View on GitHub
It uses GitHub Actions to build and update a user's contribution graph, and then has a snake eat all your contributions. The output generates a gif file, that you can then show on your GitHub Profile README. I thought this was pretty cool, so I set about adding this to my profile.

Step 1. Setting up GitHub Actions
The first thing you want to ensure before you start this project, is that you have GitHub Actions setup. Head to your Profile and ensure the "Actions" tab is available. Everyone should now have this feature.

Actions Button

Next, head to Platane's Action (available on the Marketplace) and make a copy of the code. You'll need to add this snippet into your Actions file.

Step 2. Creating your GitHub Actions yaml file
This is definitely the part where I got stuck. When looking at the code, I wasn't sure exactly where to add the lines of code mentioned on Marketplace.

After looking at the way Platane had their Actions file setup, I was able to generate the code (with a little help from Bdougie of course).

I've added the full code snippet below and added plenty of comments to (hopefully make it easy to understand).

You can copy this code straight into a blank *.yml file. Make sure you create a new *.yml file under the following directory:

YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME --> .github --> workflows --> FILE_NAME.yml



  
  
  GitHub Action for generating a contribution graph with a snake eating your contributions.


name: Generate Snake



  
  
  Controls when the action will run. This action runs every 6 hours.


on:

  schedule:

      # every 6 hours

    - cron: "0 */6 * * *"



  
  
  This command allows us to run the Action automatically from the Actions tab.


workflow_dispatch:



  
  
  The sequence of runs in this workflow:


jobs:

  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"

  build:

    # The type of runner that the job will run on

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest



# Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
steps:

# Checks repo under $GITHUB_WORKSHOP, so your job can access it
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2

# Generates the snake  
  - uses: Platane/snk@master
    id: snake-gif
    with:
      github_user_name: swayamgupta07
      # these next 2 lines generate the files on a branch called "output". This keeps the main branch from cluttering up.
      gif_out_path: dist/github-contribution-grid-snake.gif
      svg_out_path: dist/github-contribution-grid-snake.svg

 # show the status of the build. Makes it easier for debugging (if there's any issues).
  - run: git status

  # Push the changes
  - name: Push changes
    uses: ad-m/github-push-action@master
    with:
      github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      branch: master
      force: true

  - uses: crazy-max/ghaction-github-pages@v2.1.3
    with:
      # the output branch we mentioned above
      target_branch: output
      build_dir: dist
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}






Step 3. Running GitHub Actions
Once you've added the code above and committed it, head to your Actions tab. Under "Workflows", you should see the "Generate Snake" Action you created above.

Workflow

Click "Run Workflow" and watch your workflow run. You can even expand your workflow and see what's happening in real time.

Running Actions

Once your workflow has finished running, you should have received a green ‚úÖ "build" checkmark. If so, this means your Action is working nicely. If not, you'll have to go through the code and see where the errors are. The "build" status should give you some indication of where your errors lie. You can also compare it with the yaml file on my GitHub Profile README.

Build green

If you have the green "build" ‚úÖ then you should be good to go. Head back to your repo's "Code" directory, and change your branch to "output". Here you'll find the two versions of your contribution graph with the snake eating it: a *.gif and a *.svg. The good thing about these files is the file is rewritten over itself every time the Action runs. Thus, your contribution graph will always be up to date.

CodeOutput

Step 4. Adding a contribution-eating snake to your profile
Now the final set is to add this to your profile. Grab the file location of your *.gif. It should be something like:

https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_USERNAME/blob/output/github-contribution-grid-snake.gif

Add this to your profile by copying the file location onto a new line in your markdown file:

![snake gif](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_USERNAME/blob/output/github-contribution-grid-snake.gif)

Now you should have a really cool looking snake eating your contributions!

SnakeEating

Hopefully this guide was helpful for you and gives you a good base to start building and adding more Actions on your profile. What have you been adding to your GitHub Profile README? Other there other cool Actions I should be looking at?

Hi, First of all thanks for the precise tutorial!

There were a few changes in the action (mostly to adapt to github api), I had to change some parameters and bump the version.

Unfortunately a lot of people use the edge version ( with the tag #master ). It's a bit of a mess but the result is that this version is deprecated and can no longer work without adding some modification from the user (adding a github token as param)

The recommended usage is now this declaration:

- uses: Platane/snk/svg-only@v3
  with:
    github_user_name: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
    outputs: |
      dist/github-snake.svg
Check the readme for details about the new options

I didn't change the background colour. It's a .png/.svg image, meaning the background is transparent. It looks dark on mine because I have dark mode enabled on GitHub. You can enable it by clicking Settings --> Appearance --> choosing your mode.

Hello everyone, before proceeding, please navigate to 'Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow Permissions' in your README.md file and select 'Read and Write' permissions. This is important because if you have other permissions selected, it may result in errors.

Getting this error when I try to run workflow and after it fails:
Node.js 12 actions are deprecated. Please update the following actions to use Node.js 16: actions/checkout@v2. For more information see: https://github.blog/changelog/2022-09-22-github-actions-all-actions-will-begin-running-on-node16-instead-of-node12/.

If the action fails, you can go to repo settings, click action, then select general, and look at the bottom where it says read and write.

Hey Shasank. I can't see it on your profile, but to show all contributions, you need to make sure all contributions are turned on your profile. You can do this in your settings:

github.com/YOUR_PROFILE --> Settings --> Profile

Then scroll down to "Contributions" and check the box that says "Include private contributions on my profile".

Hope that helps.
